Vulnerabilities in hardware and software are omnipresent. After all, all
software and hardware is flawed beyond a certain level of complexity, and such
flaws can potentially lead to security-relevant vulnerabilities that are
exploited accordingly. Such security-relevant vulnerabilities are like open
wounds. They need to be taken care of. To do this, it must be known where the
“wound” is located, what kind of “wound” it is and how it can be healed
or at least initially treated as quickly as possible.

The digital solution for all these issues is CSAF (https://csaf.io): The Common
Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) is a standardized and open-source framework
for the communication and automated distribution of machine-processable
vulnerability and mitigation information, so-called security advisories or
security information.

CSAF significantly reduces the manual effort required to search for security
information and to determine whether products are affected or not. It allows
manufacturers, users, operators and the administration to automatically
retrieve information on individual vulnerabilities and to determine whether
they are affected. Being not affected can also be communicated in a scalable
manner (Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) as a profile in CSAF). In
the course of an increasingly networked and complex world, the number of
security-relevant vulnerabilities will grow significantly and modern
vulnerability management using CSAF documents will become indispensable. CISA
and BSI promote and demand CSAF and are organizing a total of three free
workshops on the topic of CSAF (Common Security Advisory Framework) as part of
the ACS (Alliance for Cyber Security), from 09.12.2024 to 12.12.2024.

All workshops will be recorded and afterwards edited for teaching purposes and
made publicly available. No personal data of participants will be processed or
disclosed in the publicly available videos. The workshops will be held in
English and in presence.

All workshops are limited to 40 participants. Secure your place quickly (first
come, first served) and register by 24.11.2024 at csaf@bsi.bund.de.

The workshops will be held together with the brand new [CSAF Community Days](/community-days/2024).

## Which workshop should I attend?
{{< paragraph-accent >}}
You want to use CSAF in your organisation in the future but have little or no
experience with the standard? Do you want to know what CSAF is, how to create
valid CSAF advisories and what the standard can do for you, your organisation
and your clients? You want to learn how to write CSAF-Advisories? Then the 1st
workshop is just right for you. The knowledge you have gained will be put into
practice in various exercises. Feel free to bring your questions and ask us.

Are you already using CSAF in your organisation and have gained experience? Or
do you already have prior knowledge from the 1st workshop? You know CSAF and
have already come across one or more special cases and just don’t know what
to do? Then the 2nd workshop is just right for you. Here, specific questions
about the standard and the format will be answered. We are happy to take your
input and feedback regarding your previous experiences with the CSAF standard
and answer them in the workshop. Here, too, the knowledge gained is applied
practically in various exercises.

Would you like to know more about the distribution and automated retrieval of
CSAF advisories? Have you heard of CSAF publishers, CSAF providers or CSAF
aggregators? Do you want to make CSAF files available yourself, but don’t
know how? Then you are welcome to register for workshop 3. This workshop also
includes practical exercises to consolidate the knowledge you have gained. In
addition, the distribution mechanism for CSAF documents, with the different
roles, will be implemented by all participants in the workshop.

You are welcome to register for more than one workshop.

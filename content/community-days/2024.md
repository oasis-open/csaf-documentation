### Advisory, Quo Vadis?

#### Speaker: Thomas Proell (Siemens)

**Abstract:** The number of vulnerabilities identified each year is rapidly
increasing, possibly at an exponential rate.

This surge in vulnerabilities is why machine-readable advisories were initially
requested and led to the definition of the CSAF standard. Siemens has not only
invested in creating CSAF documents but has also scaled up their production
significantly. In recent years, Siemens has published and updated over 250 CSAF
documents annually, each often detailing multiple products and vulnerabilities.

This project has provided valuable insights into what strategies were effective
and which were not. The talk will explore these lessons learned and offer
informed predictions about the future direction of this initiative. By
examining the successes and challenges faced, we can better understand how to
improve our approach to managing and communicating about vulnerabilities.

These insights are not just relevant for other CSAF creators, but also CSAF
consumers and aggregators.

**Bio:** Thomas Proell has been working for Siemens in product security for
over 15 years. After five years of penetration testing, he changed sides and is
leading the incident handling and vulnerability response team for Siemens
ProductCERT.

His goal is to push for more transparency in vulnerability handling to give
affected stakeholders all necessary information about vulnerabilities to defend
their systems. His team publishes over 250 CSAF documents annually and has
gathered a clear understanding what the upcoming challenges will come.

### CSAF Trusted Provider - Huawei Solution, Progress and Sharing of Experience

#### Speaker: Sonny van Lingen

**Abstract:** In this extensive talk, Huawei will present on its adoption and
implementation of CSAF 2.0, and its experience in setting up and operating its
CSAF Trusted Provider capability. From this context, the presentation will
provide discussion points for further industry adoption and expansion of
use-cases. The detailed outline is as follows: The presentation will begin by
explaining Huawei’s reasoning for supporting the CSAF standard, recognizing
the broader trends in the vulnerability management domain and the endorsement
of CSAF by the industry.

The discussion will then continue to outline Huawei’s approach of setting up
the CSAF Trusted Provider capability, including detailed discussion on the key
processes and requirement implementation in order to be able to comply with the
requirements laid out in Chapter 7 of the CSAF 2.0 specification. Furthermore,
this presentation will provide reflections on how Huawei was able to leverage
CSAF Open Source Tools.

We will review some considerations around CSAF’s broader adoption, including
CSAF’s potential as a standardized format across security scanners (such a
vulnerability scanners and binary scanners), as well as CSAF as a potential
approach for more efficient and streamlined regulatory compliance towards EU
regulations such as the Cyber Resilience Act.

The final segment will demonstrate Huawei’s additional capabilities for
enabling vulnerability management automation through its Machine-to-Machine
(M2M) interconnection APIs, which is another mechanism Huawei provides to its
customers to retrieve CSAF documents for automation-related use cases.

We will conclude by drawing up the lessons learned from our CSAF Trusted
Provider implementation and deployment, offering guidance and insights for
organizations that are implementing or are considering the implementation of
the CSAF Trusted Provider capabilities.

**Bio:** Sonny van Lingen is a seasoned cybersecurity professional currently
serving as a Vulnerability Governance Principal Engineer, representing Huawei
PSIRT in Europe. He has spent over a decade in numerous cybersecurity roles
within the financial and telecommunication sectors. In recent years, Sonny has
shifted his focus to PSIRT activities, dedicating the past 5.5 years to
mastering this domain. His prior key roles include positions such as Program
Manager for Ericsson’s E2E Vulnerability Management program and Master

### Correlation between CSAF and CVEs

#### Speaker: Cédric Bonhomme (CIRCL)

**Abstract:**
[Vulnerability Lookup](https://github.com/cve-search/vulnerability-lookup/)
facilitates quick correlation of vulnerabilities from various sources,
in-dependent of vulnerability IDs, and streamlines the management
of Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD). It is a rewritten
and enhanced version of cve-search, an open-source tool
originally designed to maintain a local CVE database.

For over a decade, cve-search has been maintained and operated by CIRCL.
However, we identified design and scalability limitations in the original
implementation, with its public instance currently maxing out at 20,000 queries
per second. Another aspect is the diversification of vulnerability sources
beyond just the NVD CVE. The new tool now supports additional sources such as
CSAF, GitHub, PySec, and GSD. This broadening of sources aligns with our
commitment to support the CVD process, and extending vulnerability information
in a collaborative manner. Vulnerability Lookup address these two issues: it is
fast, versatile and ease the editing of vulnerability advisories. Our aim is to
go beyond and implement innovative features tailored for CVE Numbering
Authorities (CNAs), cybersecurity vendors, incident response teams,
vulnerability reporters, and developers.

One of the main strengths of Vulnerability-Lookup is its modular system for
importing data from various vulnerability sources.

We recently introduced features related to Bundling, EPSS (Exploit Prediction
Scoring System), Sightings (from Mastodon, RSS/Atom feeds and MISP).

A demo will present the main features and the vulnerability import/correlation
mechanism between various sources (CSAF, GHSA, CVE, etc.)

**Bio:** Cédric Bonhomme is a computer scientist, intensely interested in
computer security and privacy. From 2010 to 2017, he served as an R&D Engineer
at a public research center, focusing on Multi-Agent Systems and Cybersecurity.
Since 2017, he has been part of CIRCL, where he contributes to CSIRT activities
and open-source software projects.

#### Speaker: Johannes Clos (ENISA)

**Abstract:** The most recent EU cybersecurity policy initiatives triggered
changes with a strong impact on vulnerability disclosure and management in the
European Union. The presentation will talk about the latest state of the
legislative implementations by ENISA starting with an introduction to the EU
vulnerability database (EUVD) before also describing ENISA's initial
consideration on the CRA Single Reporting Platform and what CSAF has to do with
it.

**Bio:** Johannes Clos is a National Expert seconded to the Operational
Cooperation Unit of ENISA. His main responsibilities include leading the EU
Vulnerability Database implementation, contributing to the CSIRTs Network
Secretariat, and supporting the Operations and Situational Awareness team.

### Oddities of finding and files (from an implementers view)

#### Speaker: Bernhard Reiter (Intevation GmbH)

**Abstract:** Ever wondered what the smallest or largest CSAF document is? Or
about titles: The two most common words are "Security" and "update". :) While
the average title length was 54 characters, the shortest one were the two
characters `2)`. This and more examples from measurements of roundabout 340,000
CSAF documents we could openly gather are shown. This research was not done out
of curiosity, but because we needed to assess the needed screen and disc space
for our web application.

Other surprises happened when we've actually tried to download, distribute and
display CSAF documents, such as stone age old signature formats, hitting an
overly tight rate limit or finding just too many document updates to handle.

This talk presents a number of oddities that our team stumbled upon when
implementing software for a CSAF Trusted Provider, Checker and Management
System. (Results available as Free Software, e.g.
[github.com/ISDuBA/ISDuBA](https://github.com/ISDuBA/ISDuBA) and
[github.com/gocsaf/csaf](github.com/gocsaf/csaf)).

The focus is on sharing some fun facts and implementation struggles.

**Bio:** Bernhard Reiter is a contractor to the German Federal Office of
Information Security (BSI). His team from Intevation implemented a number of
Free Software CSAF tools, like the `csaf_downloader` and a CSAF Management
System called `ISDuBA`.

The company Intevation GmbH is based in Osnabrück and Bernhard co-owns it
since 1999. He is also a Free Software activist with the FSFE and on the
advisory board of Greenbone AG.

### OT Security in Sync: A CSAF Template Powering 40+ Vendors

#### Speaker: Jochen Becker (CERT@VDE)

**Abstract:** CSAF was created with the idea of being able to map all possible
combinations of vulnerabilities, products, firmwares, softwares and so on.
While this offers the writer countless options to represent the scenario of
their vulnerability, it can be difficult for the consumer to understand these
representations from different sources or to standardize them for their own
use. As CERT@VDE, we support 40+ of our cooperation partners in their efforts
to improve the security of their products. The consumers of our advisories in
particular are therefore used to the fact that our partners' advisories are of
the same quality but also have the same format. For this reason, we have
created a CSAF template that primarily takes into account the needs of
manufacturers in the OT sector, but is also intended to support ourselves and
the reader of the CSAF document.

**Bio:** Jochen is an Information Security Manager at CERT@VDE. He took his
first 5 programming steps sometime in the 1990s on a Simatic S5. In addition to
various activities in the field of electrical engineering and computer science,
this then led to the administration of servers, networks and data centers via
the B.Sc. in computer science. With each further step in his career, his focus
shifted more and more to the field of security, while the appeal of combining
computer science and electrical engineering from the early days has remained
with him ever since. After a final stop in IT security at an insurance company,
Jochen then made the leap into operational technology and supports CERT@VDE
with his expertise in the areas of CVE, CNA, CVSS, CWE and increasingly also
CSAF.

While his professional work with vulnerabilities is now more theoretical and
procedural, OT and electrical engineering have remained a hobby for Jochen, so
that even today the soldering iron should not be too far away from the keyboard.

### Scaling CSAF: Building a Trusted Provider Network for 40+ Vendors

#### Speaker: Christian Link (CERT@VDE)

**Abstract:** The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) introduces three
distinct provider roles - Publisher, Provider, and Trusted-Provider - each with
specific requirements for secure distribution of cybersecurity advisories.
Infrastructure requirements encompass secure TLS connections, proper
certificate management and typically reverse proxy configurations and some sort
of containerization.

Our unique implementation stands out by managing over 40 trusted providers,
necessitating a scalable and automated infrastructure to handle provider
deployment and CSAF document distribution for multiple partner organizations.

This presentation outlines our approach to addressing these infrastructure
challenges while maintaining security and scalability. We've built our entire
solution stack on open-source technologies, from initial provider onboarding
through to advisory publication, ensuring transparency and cost-effectiveness.
During our proof-of-concept phase, we encountered several unexpected
challenges, particularly around certificate automation at scale and the
existing csaf tools.

**Bio:** Christian is an Information Security Manager with over three decades
of hands-on experience in cybersecurity, dating back to the early days of BBS
systems and modem communications. His extensive background spans critical
infrastructure protection across aviation and large-scale provider networks.
Currently serving as Information Security Manager for the past seven years, he
brings deep expertise in network security architecture and threat mitigation.
Throughout his career, Christian has specialized in securing complex
infrastructure systems, combining his historical knowledge of legacy systems
with modern security frameworks. When not defending networks, he enjoys making
(and sometimes breaking) things as well as getting a bird's eye view through
the goggles of his FPV-quadcopter.

### VEX-supported Vulnerability Management with SecObserve

#### Speaker: Stefan Fleckenstein & Lukas Voetmand

**Abstract:** SecObserve is an open-source vulnerability management system for
software development teams and cloud environments. It supports a variety of
open-source vulnerability scanners and integrates easily into CI/CD pipelines.
It supports CSAF-VEX documents in 2 ways: CSAF-VEX documents can be imported
and their content will be applied to vulnerabilities. On the other hand, the
results of vulnerability assessments can be exported as CSAF-VEX documents and
made available to users or business partners.

In the talk, we will start with a brief overview of SecObserve's functionality
for vulnerability management. Afterwards, we will present a practical
demonstration of a vulnerability assessment workflow including the creation and
usage of a CSAF-VEX document. The format will be very view slides and
predominantly a life demonstration.

**Bio Stefan:** After many years in software development, Stefan Fleckenstein
took over responsibility for MaibornWolff's internal IT infrastructure and
software development as CIO from 2010 to 2020. Information security became one
of the focal points of his work during this time, in which he led MaibornWolff
to the ISO 27001 certification. Combining his experiences from software
development and information security, Stefan founded the Cybersecurity
department at MaibornWolff, which advises and supports customers on all matters
relating to security.

Stefan is passionate about vulnerability management and developing open-source
software and is creator and maintainer of the Open Source vulnerability
management system SecObserve (<https://github.com/MaibornWolff/SecObserve>).

**Bio Lukas:** With over 15 years of experience in software engineering, Lukas
has evolved from a freelance developer to a DevOps specialist and is now
focused on software supply chain security. He enjoys taking a holistic approach
to software, covering everything from architectural decisions to production
deployment and application lifecycle management.

At Stackable, he leads initiatives in container image signing, SBOM generation,
and enterprise-scale vulnerability management. After evaluating several
vulnerability management solutions, he identified SecObserve as the perfect fit
for the company and occasionally contributes code back to the project.

### Integrating the CSAF Standard into Dependency-Track with Kotlin-CSAF: Early Insights and Developments

#### Speaker: Christian Banse

**Abstract:** In the rapidly evolving landscape of software development,
managing vulnerabilities efficiently and effectively is crucial to maintaining
secure systems. The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard offers a
structured approach to disseminating vulnerability information, enabling better
responses to security threats. This presentation focuses on our ongoing project
to integrate the CSAF standard into Dependency-Track, an open-source platform
dedicated to managing and tracking software dependencies, with the aid of our
newly developed library, Kotlin-CSAF.

Kotlin-CSAF plays a crucial role in this integration effort by handling the
retrieval, validation, and loading of CSAF documents. This library is designed
to function independently of Dependency-Track, offering flexible solutions for
various applications requiring CSAF document management. By leveraging
Kotlin-CSAF, we aim to enhance Dependency-Track's capabilities, allowing it to
process structured security advisories seamlessly.

Though the project is still in development, we will present our initial
findings and demonstrate the progress made so far. The presentation will cover
the technical aspects of integrating Kotlin-CSAF with Dependency-Track,
addressing the challenges encountered and the solutions implemented. We will
showcase how this integration improves the accuracy and timeliness of
vulnerability management workflows, providing tangible benefits to
organizations.

This initiative is hosted on GitHub, fostering community collaboration and
feedback. We invite stakeholders from the CSAF community to engage with our
project, contribute enhancements, and help shape the future of secure software
supply chains. Join us to explore how Kotlin-CSAF and the CSAF standard, when
integrated into Dependency-Track, can redefine vulnerability management,
ensuring robust defenses against emerging threats.

**Bio:** Christian Banse holds a Master of Science in Business Informatics with a
focus on IT security from the University of Regensburg. Since 2011 he has been a
staff member at Fraunhofer AISEC. Since mid-2018 Christian Banse has also been
head of the Service and Application Security department and is, among other things,
responsible for the topic of Cloud assurance His team also develops and integrates
vulnerability advisories and automation workflows based on the OASIS Common Security
Advisory Framework (CSAF) to support standardized, machine-readable security notifications
and continuous certification.

### Handling lots of Incoming Documents as Team with ISDuBA — a CSAF Management System Web App

#### Speaker: Bernhard Reiter (Intevation GmbH)

**Abstract:** Expecting a rising influx of CSAF documents, it makes sense to
track them and find out which are of interest to your organisation. Add a team
being responsible for a larger number of IT products like a Computer Emergency
Response Team, ... next you need a _CSAF management system_ to handle the load.

The German Federal Office of Germany (BSI) has contracted the implementation of
such a system geared for internal use as Free Software (sometimes called "Open
Source Software"). The resulting web application is named
[ISDuBA](https://github.com/ISDuBA/ISDuBA) and offers to support several teams
working on incoming CSAF documents.

ISDuBA can follow CSAF Providers and aggregators automatically, comes with a
workflow model and a role based permission system using an external identity
management system like Keycloak. Revisions of CSAF documents can be compared to
each other. Users can see comments of colleagues, decide on a
Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Category, forward a document to a different
system and finally archive or delete a group of documents once they are done
with them.

A live demo of the main functions will show you what ISDuBA can do.

### Demonstrator with CSAF-Matching from the Project ZenSIM4.0

#### Speaker: Dr. Salva Daneshgadeh Cakmakci

**Abstract:** The aim of the BMBF project “Central Security Incident
Management for SMEs in Industry 4.0” (ZenSIM 4.0, <https://zensim-project.de>)
is to support manufacturers and operators of Industry 4.0 environments from the
SME environment in the independent operation of IT security management. A
specific platform was developed for this purpose, which enables IT security
incident management. This platform enables SMEs to stay informed about
vulnerabilities in their assets and proactively prevent potential cyber
incidents. The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) was used as a central
tool in the project and an initial demonstrator was developed. This will be
presented at the CSAF Community Days.

Within the project ZenSIM 4.0 we extended our Security Information and Event
Management (SIEM) solution (ScanBox) for Industrial Control Systems (ICS)
networks. This system aims to enhance vulnerability detection and response
through the automated integration of Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)
documents. By continuously ingesting and analyzing CSAF data, the system
identifies vulnerabilities in ICS assets and provides actionable remediation
guidelines for security teams.

The demonstration includes several key components: Asset Discovery, a CSAF
Analysis Engine, and a Ticket Generator. The Asset Discovery module maps
networked assets, while the CSAF Analysis Engine compares these assets with the
latest CSAF advisories. Detected vulnerabilities trigger alerts—referred to
as "tickets"—containing detailed information about the affected assets,
potential risks, and tailored remediation steps. Each ticket includes a
playbook, populated with strategies outlined in the corresponding CSAF
document, to guide security teams through efficient response actions.

The presentation will provide an overview of the proposed solution, alongside a
short video demonstration of the system in action.

**Bio:** Dr. Salva Daneshgadeh Cakmakci is a researcher specializing in network
security. She earned her Ph.D. in Information Systems form The Middle East
Technical University (METU) in Ankara, Turkey, 2019. Then she has held
postdoctoral positions at the University of Bremen's Department of Computer
Science, focusing on scalable security architectures for business processes in
German ports. She is currently affiliated with DECOIT GmbH & Co. KG in Bremen,
Germany, contributing to projects on cybersecurity and SIEM. Her research
interests include network and information security, data science and artificial
intelligence. She has authored several publications on topics such as
Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack detection and Advanced Persistent
Threat (APT) detection.

### Experiences in Consuming CSAFs & What is Still Missing

#### Speaker: Tobias Limmer & Michael Pfurtscheller

**Abstract:** Siemens not only publishes CSAFs (Common Security Advisory
Framework) but also consumes advisories through an automated process. Tobias
Limmer will provide insights into his experiences with processing CSAF data and
matching it against assets, highlighting potential improvements in the CSAF
specification. While Security Advisories are necessary and helpful,
vulnerabilities are ultimately resolved through updates/patching of hard and
software. Michael Pfurtscheller will discuss the challenges of consuming and
publishing updates from different perspectives within the supply chain,
covering roles such as:

* Hardware or Software Component Developers
* Product & Device Manufacturers
* Solution and Application Developers
* Product Integrators like Factory Operators, Car Manufacturers, etc.

**Bio Tobias Limmer:** Tobias Limmer has been in the security field for 20
years, with over a decade of experience focused on the industrial side of IT
infrastructures. He began his journey with vulnerability handling at Siemens
ProductCERT, where he played a key role in automating security tests. His
current research areas include tool-based vulnerability management and
risk-based mitigation decisions.

**Bio Michael Pfurtscheller:** Michael Pfurtscheller is the Product Security
Manager at u-blox AG but has mainly worked as a consultant since 1998. Security
was always part of the job when working in the fields of SAP programming,
management of messaging and collaboration infrastructures, network and
computing center infrastructures, e-commerce projects and Pentesting.
Currently, he focuses on establishing an ISO 21434-compliant Cybersecurity
Management System (CSMS) for u-blox and its GNSS and IoT products, including
vulnerability, incident, and update management for its modules and firmware.

### How to get CSAF into Contracts

#### Speaker: Thomas Schmidt (BSI)

**Abstract:** It is quite difficult to convince the purchase department to have
specific technical requirements included in each and every contract. As CISOs
might be in the position to mandate such a rule, it seems to be a burden to
figure out what exactly is needed from CSAF in the current state of the art.
The BSI TR-03191 provides an easy to use document to mandate CSAF to all
suppliers.

**Bio:** Thomas Schmidt works in the 'Industrial Automation and Control
Systems' section of the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI).
His focus is the automation of advisories at both sides: vendors/CERTs and
asset owners. Schmidt has been a leader in the OASIS Open CSAF technical
committee, and key in bridging this work with the CISA SBOM work. Prior to
this, Schmidt was BSI's lead analyst for TRITION/TRISIS/HatMan and developed,
together with partners, a rule set for Recognizing Anomalies in Protocols of
Safety Networks: Schneider Electric's TriStation (RAPSN SETS). To increase
security of ICS and the broader ecosystem, BSI responsibilities cover many
areas including establishing trust and good relations with vendors and asset
owners. Mr. Schmidt completed his masters in IT-Security at Ruhr-University
Bochum (Germany) which included a period of research at the SCADA Security
Laboratory of Queensland University of Technology (Brisbane, Australia).

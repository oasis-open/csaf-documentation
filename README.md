## Statement of Purpose

Statement of Purpose for this OASIS TC Open Repository (csaf-documentation) as [proposed](https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/csaf/201710/msg00008.html) and [approved](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/61796/csaf-minutes-20170927-meeting-10.html) \[[bis](https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/TCADMIN-2786)\] by the TC:

The purpose of this GitHub public repository is to support development of open source resources and documentation related to CSAF Technical Committee work.

The OASIS CSAF Technical Committee was [chartered](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/csaf/charter.php) to make a major revision to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Framework (CVRF) under a new name for the framework that reflects the primary purpose: a Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF). TC deliverables are designed standardize existing practice in structured machine-readable vulnerability-related advisories and further refine those standards over time.

The Common Security Advisory Framework's (CSAF) Common Vulnerability Reporting Framework (CVRF) is a language to exchange Security Advisories formulated in XML. The term _Security Advisory_ describes any notification of security issues in products of and by providers. Anyone providing a product is considered in this document as a vendor, i.e. developers or maintainers of information system products or services. This includes all authoritative product vendors, Product Security Incident Response Teams (PSIRTs), and product resellers and distributors, including authoritative vendor partners.
